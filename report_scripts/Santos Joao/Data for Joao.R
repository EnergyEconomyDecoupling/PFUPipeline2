# These data are for Joao Santos.
# See Joao's email of 28 May 2025
#
# From what I understood of our email exchange,
# the data in the repository includes the NEU, correct?
# So I would think that, for France (and Austria as well)
# we have been using data with NEU, and
# comparing it with Andr√©'s data without the NEU
# (in the case of France, specifically).
# So, we would like to get the data from the repository
# without the NEU for France and Austria.
#
# Or, to make things easier and if not more work for you,
# could you send us the data for both France and Austria
# with and without the NEU?
# Both exergy and energy would be useful to us.
#
# Regarding data file, .csv would be fine.
